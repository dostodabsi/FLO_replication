# Replication of the Feature-Label-Order Hypothesis
This is the repo associated with our replication of Experiment I of Ramscar & Dye (2009), see [here](http://www.nbu.bg/cogs/analogy09/proceedings/41-T38.pdf)
and [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1551-6709.2009.01092.x/full) for a more extensive treatment.
We will use Amazon Mechanical Turk to gather participants. Results will be analyzed using Bayesian Signal Detection Theory
and Mixed Logit Models (see slides/sketch.pdf for details). Stimuli (Fribbles) are from [here](http://wiki.cnbc.cmu.edu/Novel_Objects).

## Disclaimer
This is a student project. We will also pre-register this experiment on the Open Science Framework ([here](https://osf.io)).
I have strong opinions that this is how research in psychology / cognitive science should be done - pre-registered (if
confirmatory; why? see e.g. [here](http://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2014/may/20/psychology-registration-revolution))
and open - with raw data, materials, code and analysis easy to obtain. By conducting a pre-registered replication we hope to
gain some practical knowledge on how to do just that.
