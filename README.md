# Replication of Feature-Label-Ordering
This is the repo associated with our replication of Experiment I of Ramscar & Dye (2009), see [here](http://www.nbu.bg/cogs/analogy09/proceedings/41-T38.pdf)
and [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1551-6709.2009.01092.x/full) for a more extensive treatment.
We will use Amazon Mechanical Turk to gather participants. Results will be analyzed using Bayesian Signal Detection Theory
and Hierarchical Logit Models (see preregistration/preregistration.pdf for details). Stimuli (Fribbles) are from [here](http://wiki.cnbc.cmu.edu/Novel_Objects).
